# AllyCat

**AllyCat** is a full stack, open source chatbot that uses GenAI LLMs to answer questions about your website with both traditional Vector RAG and advanced GraphRAG capabilities. It is simple by design and will run on your laptop or server. 

## Why?

AllyCat is purposefully simple so it can be used by developers to learn how RAG-based GenAI works. Yet it is powerful enough to use with your website. You may also extend it for your own purposes.

## How does it work? 
AllyCat uses your choice of LLM and vector database to implement a chatbot written in Python using [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) architecture.
AllyCat also includes web scraping tools that extract data from your website (or any website).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èQuickstart ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

There are two ways to run Allycat.

### Option 1: Use the Docker image

A great option for a quick evaluation.  
See [running AllyCat using docker](docs/running-in-docker.md)

### Option 2: Run natively (for tweaking, developing)

Choose this option if you want to tweak AllyCat to fit your needs. For example, experimenting with embedding models or LLMs.  
See [running AllyCat natively](docs/running-natively.md)
